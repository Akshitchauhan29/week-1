# EV Charging Demand Prediction 🚗⚡

This project predicts the electricity demand for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging using a simple Linear Regression model in Python. It takes into account environmental and historical factors such as temperature and previous day's demand to estimate the next day's electricity requirements.
