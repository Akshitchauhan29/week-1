# EV Charging Demand Prediction 🚗⚡

This project predicts the electricity demand for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging using historical and weather data.

## 🔍 Project Description
A simple machine learning model (Linear Regression) that forecasts demand based on temperature and past data.

## 📁 Files
- `EV_Demand_Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `ev_demand_sample.csv`: Sample dataset
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## 📊 Output
The model predicts charging demand with good accuracy and can be improved using real-time datasets.
