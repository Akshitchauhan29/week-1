EV Charging Demand Prediction 🚗⚡
This project predicts the electricity demand for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging using a simple Linear Regression model in Python. It takes into account environmental and historical factors such as temperature and previous day's demand to estimate the next day's electricity requirements.

📁 Project Structure
EV_Demand_Prediction.ipynb - Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and results.
ev_demand_sample.csv - Sample dataset used for prediction (optional).
README.md - Project description and instructions.
